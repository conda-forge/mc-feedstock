  summary: GNU Midnight Commander is a visual file manager
  description: |
    GNU Midnight Commander is a visual file manager, licensed under GNU General
    Public License and therefore qualifies as Free Software. It's a feature
    rich full-screen text mode application that allows you to copy, move and
    delete files and whole directory trees, search for files and run commands
    in the subshell. Internal viewer and editor are included.

    Midnight Commander is based on versatile text interfaces, such as Ncurses
    or S-Lang, which allows it to work on a regular console, inside an X Window
    terminal, over SSH connections and all kinds of remote shells.
